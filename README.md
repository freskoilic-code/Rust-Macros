# 🎮 Rust Macro Preset Manager

This project is a lightweight desktop utility designed to help users manage and apply customizable mouse input presets for Rust gameplay. The main goal of this tool is to provide a clean and user-friendly way to organize different configurations for various weapons and playstyles while keeping the setup process as simple as possible.

The program supports flexible profile switching, meaning you can create multiple preset configurations and quickly swap between them depending on the weapon or situation. Each profile can be adjusted to match your preferred sensitivity, DPI, and in-game settings. This allows the user to fine-tune mouse movement behavior for a smoother and more consistent experience.

One of the biggest advantages of this tool is its universal compatibility. It is designed to work with any mouse brand and does not require special drivers or hardware modifications. The utility focuses on clean execution and minimal system impact, making it lightweight and easy to use even on low-end PCs.

The tool also includes an advanced configuration system that allows precise control over timing values and movement patterns. Profiles can be saved, loaded, and edited at any time. This makes it ideal for players who want to experiment with different setups and keep their configurations organized.

To improve usability, the program provides a simple interface and fast installation process. The software is distributed as a standalone .exe, so you can launch it instantly without complicated dependencies.
